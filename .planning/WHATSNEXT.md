# What's Next

## Current State

All planned features are delivered (Phases 1-4). The bot captures text notes and URL bookmarks with AI-generated metadata, publishes readable summaries to Telegraph, and saves everything to an Obsidian vault.

## Future Ideas

Features to consider based on usage:

- **Voice note support** -- Transcribe audio + run through same capture pipeline
- **Review commands** -- `/inbox` to list unprocessed notes, `/review` for guided processing
- **Image capture** -- Save images with AI-generated descriptions
- **Multi-URL handling** -- Better support for messages with multiple links
- **Vault search** -- Search existing notes from Telegram

See `.planning/research/IMPROVEMENT-OPTIONS-REPORT.md` for the full prioritized feature list.
